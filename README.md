#### In the polluted Land of Fires, a mysterious mechanical fairy is fighting toxic waste with her purifying magic to defend nature.

Land of Fires, an arcade shoot 'em up game featuring gloomy, yet sharply animated pixel art, was developed in the span of eleven days by a team of five, using the SpriteKit framework.
